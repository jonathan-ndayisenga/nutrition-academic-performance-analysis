# Nutritional Habits and Academic Performance: A Data-Driven Investigation

This mini-project explores the relationship between studentsâ€™ nutritional habits and their academic performance using a real-world dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Summary

- **Tools used:** Python (Pandas), R (stats & visualization), Excel
- **Focus areas:**
  - Does eating breakfast improve GPA?
  - Do vitamin users consume more vegetables?
  - Is there a correlation between calorie intake and academic performance?
  - Are fruit and vegetable intakes linked?

## Data Cleaning (Python)
Used `pandas` to clean missing values, convert datatypes, and prep the dataset for hypothesis testing.

## Hypothesis Testing (R)
Performed:
- T-tests for group comparisons
- Chi-squared test for associations
- Correlation tests
- Data visualizations (boxplots, scatter plots)

## ðŸ“Ž Results Summary
- No significant link between breakfast and GPA.
- Vitamin users eat more vegetables (p < 0.01).
- Fruit and vegetable intake are strongly correlated.
- No significant correlation between calories and GPA.
